# Django and psycopg2 are included in the django base container, but the analysis
# container also needs them, and uses this same requirements file.
# Which means the versions here will be the ones that get installed, in both places.
# Ideally these should be kept in sync with the versions in the base container
# (https://github.com/azavea/docker-django/blob/master/3.2/requirements.txt) to avoid
# downgrading when building the django container.
