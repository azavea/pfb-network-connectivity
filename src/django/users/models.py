    Every user will belong to an organization. Organization membership will determine

    **Admin.** Membership in the admin organization will grant access to all other organizations,
    and the ability to create/delete users within the system. Membership in this organization
    will be tightly controlled and will be limited to PFB personnel who are responsible
    for activating/deactivating neighborhood sites and creating initial admin users
    within a neighborhood organization.

    **Subscriber.** Membership in a subscriber organization grants read-only access to results data.

    users and manage the neighborhood site.

    levels at or below their own.
